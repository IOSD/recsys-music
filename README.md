# Music/Songs Recommendation System
Task is to design a personalized recommendation system for music. Depending on experience level of the students, they can choose it to be content based or popularity based model. Content based model will require processing music features and recommending similar music. Extra points will be awarded if students can deploy the recommendation system through a web application or mobile application. 

**Skills Required:** Python, Object-Oriented Programming, Knowledge of Recommendation Systems, Matrix Factorization, Collaborative Filtering. Famous DL Libraries like Tensorflow or Keras. Optional Skills include Full stack web app, Android/iOS App Development.
